# project-calculator

As a developer, I have built a calculator using React.js, a powerful JavaScript library widely used to create complex and interactive user interfaces. The process of building this calculator required a deep understanding of React's concepts and components, such as the component lifecycle, state management, and JSX.

I began by planning and designing the layout and functionality of the calculator, breaking it down into smaller, reusable components for better organization and structure. I then implemented the logic for the calculations using JavaScript and integrated other tools and libraries, such as Redux for state management, to manage the data flow and state of the application.

During the development process, I also made sure to test the components and ensure they were functioning correctly, using testing libraries such as Jest and Enzyme. This helped me to catch any bugs or errors early on and improve the overall quality of the application.

Overall, building this calculator using React.js was a challenging but rewarding experience that allowed me to showcase my skills as a developer and gain a deeper understanding of the library. I am proud to have built this calculator and I am eager to share it with the community and get feedback.
